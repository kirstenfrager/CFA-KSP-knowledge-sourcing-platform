KSP - The Knowledge Sourcing Platform
===================


Our internal hackathon's theme was **education**; we were given three problems within this field and had to choose one and come up with a solution.

1. Poor access to tech education for disabled learners
2. How do you know what you donâ€™t know if self educating?
3. Hard to accommodate both students who are struggling and excelling in a classroom

We were given a timeframe of two-days and optional weekend work.

----------
Project
-------------

Our project revolves around the problem of "how do you know what you don't know if self educating?". To address this issue we built ***KPS : a Knowledge Sourcing Platform for self-learning developers***. KPS is a software development community which allows both experienced and new developers to create/publish articles related to latest trends, learning suggestions, and programming fundamentals. The user base then has the ability to up and downvote each article based on their importance; creating an ever evolving list of learning essentials and allowing self-learners to explore previously unexplored areas of software development. Each user can:
> - Choose their preferred programming language;
> - The user will be directed to an index list of capabilities which are found in that specific programming language;
> - Each capability will contain at least one topic with detailed documentation and resources uploaded by an experienced user;
> - Users will be encouraged to upvote or downvote the topic; the highest voted topic will be at the top of the list;

Each post is reviewed by an Admin, who can edit and delete the posts.

Getting Started
-------------

#### <i class="icon-cog"></i> Starting a new Rails Application
Terminal Commands:
```ruby
$ rails new <projectname> --database=postgresql
```
```ruby
$ rake db:create
```
```ruby
$ rake db:migrate
```
To check  if your rails application is running:
```ruby
$ rails s
```

#### <i class="icon-cog"></i> Gem Installations

Within the rails project, folder  *Gemfile* the following gems were installed:

| Gem     | Installation | 	Usage   |
| :------- | ----: | :---: |
| bootstrap | gem 'bootstrap-sass' |  CSS framework   |
| devise | gem 'devise' |  authentication solution    |
| rolify    | gem 'rolify'   |  authorization system  |
| pundit     | gem 'pundit'    |  authentication system  |
| acts as votable    | gem 'acts_as_votable'   |  acts as votable   |
| rpsec    | gem 'rspec-rails'   |  allows testing   |

Design Journey
-------------
#### <i class="icon-pencil"></i> Step One: Brainstorm Session

We focused our brainstorming session around problems two and three and wrote down words which we felt were related to each of these points.

#### <i class="icon-pencil"></i> Step Two: Building on Ideas

Some ideas we came up with based on our brainstorming discussions were:

> **Idea 1: The Bot**

> - A bot which scans the code you are writing; maybe an atom plugin? And is able to recognise repetition of code structures or perhaps the repetition of gems which the user uses in all of their projects
> - The bot suggests alternative methods of code structures/methods, or different gems which the user can use instead
> - The bot provides these alternative methods which the user can acknowledge and get redirected to a page where all the bot's suggestions are; the user can read up on new material etc

> **Idea 2: Pair Programming Matcher**

> - A platform which is able to match different skill levels in the class with each other
> - Allows exceeding students to gain new responsibilities of trying to teach/mentor less knowledgable students

> **Idea 3: Knowledge Platform**

> - An area for self-educating developers to go and be able to see what other industry experts/students/workers think is important to know within the programming language
> - Voting system which is controller by users so that they can decide what topics are more important than others
> - Self-educators are able to go onto this platform and see what their knowledge gaps might be

#### <i class="icon-pencil"></i> Step 3: Chosen Idea

Idea 3 was chosen. We used *Trello* to start writing user stories and decide on our MVP. *Trello* was heavily used within our project to designate tasks, communicate with each other, write ideas and so on.

Some wire-framing ideas and which types of models and pages we would need were also brainstormed.

Project Future
-------------

#### <i class="icon-pencil"></i> Features

There are a number of features that were not implemented in the prototype build of KSP. A future version of the product might include:
> - More functional styling;
> - The ability for users to "favourite" articles;
> - An in-built forum for user discussions;
> - The ability for users to "comment" on articles;
> - User profiles;
> - Social media sharing;
> - Greater admin and moderator capabilities (i.e. approving and merging articles, deleting users);

#### <i class="icon-pencil"></i> Outstanding issues

A number of issues present within the prototype still need to be resolved. These include:
> - "Back" button within post/show page unresponsive after a "vote" is placed. Requires mapping to previous topic_id.;
> - New post currently replacing topic_id with its own post_id in url upon creation;
> - Site currently unresponsive for mobiles, ipads;
> - Prototype built without using TDD. Greater testing required;
